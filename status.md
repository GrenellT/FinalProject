Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have done the majority of my project. I have coded the majority of attacks and the mechanics for the actual fight. I have made it so it randomly chooses an opponent and randomly chooses who attacks first.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not done anything in terms of potential visuals and I have yet to code a stop to the program where the battle ends if somebody loses all their health.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have yet to really encounter any real problems. I did have to switch up one attack for one of the characters as I could not think of how to code it.
