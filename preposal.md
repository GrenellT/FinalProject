# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?


A few ideas that I have include:

1. A tool that assists in poker in which the player can type in what cards they have and what cards are in the community pile so that the program will output the odds of them having the best possible hand.
2. A game that I guess can be compared to the Pokemon video games in which you can select who you would like to play as, they will have four moves, and based off random chances you can deliver more or less damage with each attack on your opponent(ex. Critical hit, missed attack, etc).
3. A guessing game in which you select a difficulty in both number of guesses and the range of numbers where you attempt to guess the random number within the range of numbers. After every guess you will receive the hint that the number is either higher or lower.


## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will most likely be working solo on this project.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

As of right now, I do not have any questions.
