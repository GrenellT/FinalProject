# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Walmart Brand Pokemon Battle.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will make a program that essentially lets someone choose a character in which they can battle the computer.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My program will start by allowing the player to select a character. Then, the player will be able to select from a set of moves for that character and attack or defend themselves based on a turn-based game. The game will continue until either that player or the computer has defeated the other’s character.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my project would be that I am able to successfully create a balanced battle between two characters that make it an even fight.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best possible outcome for my project would be that I am able to implement multiple characters and multiple moves that each have different benefits.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome for my final project would be having multiple characters each with their own unique and balanced moves that allow for an even battle. Hopefully, I will be able to combine multiple characters into a single battle, having it be a 2v2 or a 3v3.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I believe that I currently have most of the skillsets that I will need in order to complete this project. I am sure that I will run into a few road bumps here and there but for the most part will be completely capable of completing my project. My next steps would be to simply brain storm different ideas for the characters and their moves and how to make them balanced.
