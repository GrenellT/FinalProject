# FinalProject

Creating this project was definitely a huge learning experience for me. While I didn't run in to too many problems with my coding, it was definitely exciting trying to figure out how to write this program.
The only real problems that I ran into were trying to write the code for different attacks for the characters and how to implement them without ruining the mechanics of the actual fight.
I did actually have to change up one attack for one of the characters as I simply could not figure out how to write the code while leaving everything else intact. But, I think that I was able to come up with another idea that was actually even better than the first.
One thing that I can definitely take away from this project is the use of global variables. While I did know they were a thing, I never really had a use for them before. I had to learn how to incorporate them into this program in order for it to work, which was fun.
